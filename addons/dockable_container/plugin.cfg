name="Dockable Container"
description="Container script that manages docking/tiling UI panels.

Panels are composed of tabs that can be dragged around and dropped to split another panel or compose its tabs.

Layout information is stored in Resource objects, so they can be saved/loaded from disk easily.

This plugin also offers a replica of the Container layout to be edited directly in the inspector."
