- Control + Mouse wheel can now be used to adjust the brush size and shape thickness. Unfortunately, this shortcut cannot be edited at the moment, but it will be in the future (most likely once we port to Godot 4.x). [#776](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/discussions/776)
- Snapping to the grid and guides has been implemented.
- Changing the renderer from GLES2 to GLES3 and vice versa is now possible in the preferences.

- If Pixelorama crashes during saving of a .pxo file and a file of the same name already exists in that directory, it no longer gets replaced with an empty 0 byte file. [#763](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/763)
- [macOS] Fixed issue where tool shortcuts changed tools. [#784](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/784)
- The movement preview now works as intended for all selected cels [#811](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/811) for the move tool, [5cb0edd](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/5cb0eddae5983b29a378a34ad4919116f911a403) for the selected content.
- The UI scale no longer is 0.75 by default. This fixes blurry fonts on small monitors.
- Pasted content should no longer get placed in sub-pixel positions. [403539b](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/403539bb4794d81289214c4eda5226e70b9af19a)
- The notifications always appear on the bottom left of the main canvas and are no longer dependent on the position of the timeline.

- Using the selection gizmos when an overlay window is directly on top of them is no longer possible.
- Fix bug where the tool changes from a draw tool to a non-draw tool, while having an image brush selected. The bug was that the indicator was appearing as a white square, until the user moved their mouse.
- The right tool gets activated only if the right mouse button (or whatever input action is assigned) is first pressed. [cc332c6](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/cc332c6cbf3f9265a95a4bdc4998c9ca6c4f750a)
- No more errors in the debugger or the terminal appear when attempting to undo/redo while drawing. [af2b1fe](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/af2b1feb1f63144ebce00520ea2f8ee832dc49bd)

## [v0.10.3] - 2022-09-26
This update has been brought to you by the contributions of:
Fayez Akhtar ([@Variable-ind](https://github.com/Variable-ind))

### Added
- The UI now automatically gets scaled, based on the dpi and resolution of the monitor. Resolves [#643](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/643).
- A "Divide into equal parts" button has been added in Gradient Map. This is meant for easy gradient bisecting, which is helpful for converting Linear/Cubic interpolated gradients into Constant. This will eventually be used in gradient generation as well, once multi-color gradient generation support gets implemented.
- A new fill area option has been added to the bucket tool options, "Whole Selection". This fills the entire selection with a color or pattern, regardless of the colors of the pixels.
- The UI can now be scaled down to 0.5 and 0.75.
- Palette swatches now get highlighted if their color is selected from the color buttons. [#730](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/730)
- Project tabs can now be closed with the middle mouse button.
- Non-keyboard shortcut bindings for tools are now allowed. You can, for example, map your tools to a mouse or gamepad button.
- The background color of the canvas is now configurable, as requested in [#586](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/discussions/586).

### Changed
- Circle brushes now scale properly and support even-numbered diameters.
- Copy, cut & delete now affect the entire cel if there is no selection.
- The paste placement behavior has been changed. Paste now places the pasted content in the middle of the canvas view, instead of its original position. A new option in the Edit menu has been added, "Paste in Place", that preserves the previous behavior.
- If a layer is locked or invisible, the cursor changes into forbidden when the user is hovering the mouse over the canvas.
- The left & right tool options now have a header with the name of the currently selected tool, and a color indicator on the top.
- The preferences dialog has been polished. Headers have been added for each segment, and all of the elements are now vertically aligned with each other.
- hiDPI is now enabled - solves [#159](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/159).
- The recent projects menu now makes the most recent project appear on top, and if you open a project already in the recent projects list, it would then be moved to the most recent spot on the list. [#755](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/755)
- The import dialog now remembers the last option. [#754](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/754)
- In the bucket tool options, "Same color area" and "Same color pixels" have been renamed to "Similar area" and "Similar colors" respectively.
- The splash and preference dialogs can now be resized to a smaller size than the default.

### Fixed
- Deleting content from locked/invisible layers is no longer possible.
- Selection can no longer be moved if there is a dialog open.
- Tool and menu shortcuts no longer get activated if a dialog is open. [#709](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/709).
- Onion skinning now works properly with mirror view. Addresses part of [#717](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/717).
- Fix invalid pattern image error when using the bucket tool to replace colors.
- Fixed issue with the bucket tool where if the selected color is the same as the pixel's color in mouse position, the operation stops even if there are other cels selected.
- The "Close" button in the preferences no longer remains stuck in the previous language, if the language changes and the previous one was not English.

## [v0.10.2] - 2022-08-18

Fayez Akhtar ([@Variable-ind](https://github.com/Variable-ind)), [@GrantMoyer](https://github.com/GrantMoyer)

### Added
- A gradient map image effect. Addresses the second half of [#595](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/discussions/595).
- A new rotation type, Rotxel with smear. Thanks to [azagaya](https://github.com/azagaya) for the shader code.
- The pivot in the rotate image dialog can now be changed by the user. [#720](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/720)

- The left and right tool colors in the background of the tool buttons and the indicators on the canvas can now be changed from the Preferences.
- Added Danish translations.

### Changed
- Copying now works between multiple Pixelorama instances, and the clipboard is even being remembered when the app closes. Note that you cannot copy image data to another software, and you cannot paste image data from another software into Pixelorama. [#693](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/693)
- Importing multiple images at once from File, Open is now possible.
- On image effect dialogs, the preview will show all of the selected cels instead of only one cel. [#722](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/722)

- Even-numbered thickness sizes on the rectangle and ellipse shape tools now work as expected. The thickness of the shapes no longer goes up by 2 pixels. [23f591a](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/23f591a8626c12fd7e6344ab59f8e33b8d20cb99)
- [[Keychain](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Keychain)] Fixed issue with menu events being triggered by actions that are not exact matches. This means that, for example, "Control + Shift + S" will no longer activate both "Save" and "Save as", but only "Save as". [09c9583](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Keychain/commit/09c95835ef034effa949732cf9cf9bd315ed08a8)
- Massively improved the performance of the selection system, most notably the Rectangle Selection and Select by Color tools, and selection content deletion. [#710](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/710)
- Performance when drawing big lines on big canvases has been increased, thanks to the update to Godot 3.5. Most likely due to [godotengine/godot#62826](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/62826)
- Fixed issue with save file dialog taking the name of the first file it sees. [5d65e82](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/5d65e820708ed7586fdb7f0ac4633f7b468ec73d)

- Window transparency now only affects the transparency of the Main Canvas's TabContainer. [#734](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/734)

## [v0.10.1] - 2022-06-06
This update has been brought to you by the contributions of:
Fayez Akhtar ([@Variable-ind](https://github.com/Variable-ind)), Matteo Piovanelli ([@MatteoPiovanelli-Laser](https://github.com/MatteoPiovanelli-Laser)), [@AlphinAlbukhari](https://github.com/AlphinAlbukhari), Martin Nov√°k ([@novhack](https://github.com/novhack))

### Added
- The [Keychain plugin](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Keychain) has been implemented. Keychain makes Pixelorama's shortcut system fully configurable, and it provides the ability to the users to set custom shortcuts of every input type for all input actions. The plugin is developed by us and it's free to use for your own Godot projects as well! [#700](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/700)
- The cursor can now be moved with the numpad arrow keys and gamepad's left stick and d-pad, the canvas can be moved with gamepad's right stick and it is also possible to map the activate left and right tool actions to keyboard and gamepad buttons, to allow drawing from these devices, making Pixelorama a lot more accessible. Made possible by the Keychain plugin.
- A lot more gradient options have been added. Apart from the Linear Step gradient, there are now Linear, Radial, Radial Step, Linear Dithering and Radial Dithering gradient types. They are all shader-based, so they are a lot faster than the previous method. [#677](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/677)
- A drop shadow image effect has been added. [#674](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/674)
- A new rotation method has been added. It is shader-based, therefore faster than the other methods. [#683](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/683)
- All menu items now have changeable shortcuts. Made possible by the Keychain plugin.
- The dimensions of the exported file(s) are now visible in the export dialog. [#686](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/686)

### Changed
- The outline effect is now generated using shaders, except in the Web platform. This makes outline generation more faster and gives better results.
- In the backup confirmation dialog, "Delete" has been changed to "Discard all" and a Cancel button has been added.
- Grid, pixel grid, rulers and guides view menu settings are now being remembered when Pixelorama closes and opens again.
- The export window is now more clear if the directory path, the file name or both are invalid. [#669](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/669)
- Timeline scroll behavior has been tweaked. [#682](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/682)
- Image brush size is now using percentage suffix (%) instead of pixels (px). [#671](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/671)
- The brushes popup tab alignment and position has changed depending on where it's asked to popup. [#671](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/671)
- It is now possible to delete content from all selected cels.

### Fixed
- The flood fill algorithm (bucket tool's "same color area" mode) is now a lot faster. [#667](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/667) and [#672](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/672)
- Based on the above, the magic wand tool is also a lot faster.
- Shader-based image effects are now a lot faster if there is no selection.
- GIF exporting is now faster. [#696](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/696)
- Fixed issue with the bucket tool's "same color pixels" method not working in all selected cels.
- Fixed broken 90-degree rotation. [#676](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/676)
- Fixed export bug where the path is being changed if there's a folder with the same name as the file.
- Fixed visual bug caused by window opacity. [#680](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/680)
- It is no longer possible to delete content from cels belonging to invisible or locked cels.
- Scale image aspect ratio is now updating correctly when the dialog is about to appear.
- Going into fullscreen mode and then exiting it no longer makes the window opacity not working properly. Note that window opacity still does not work when in fullscreen mode.

## [v0.10] - 2022-04-15

Fayez Akhtar ([@Variable-ind](https://github.com/Variable-ind)), Martin Nov√°k ([@novhack](https://github.com/novhack)), Lili Zoey ([@sayaks](https://github.com/sayaks)), [@ArthyChaux](https://github.com/ArthyChaux)

### Added
- A new Window menu has been added that has the new UI system options, as well as Zen mode and Fullscreen mode that were previously under the View menu.
- A similarity option has been added to the "same color pixels" mode of the bucket tool. [#649](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/649)
- Added an experimental Extensions system that will let the users make their own extensions that add new functionality to Pixelorama. Keep in mind that this is still experimental and backwards compatibility is NOT guaranteed - use at your own risk.
- A grayscale mode for the canvas has been added to the View menu. [#646](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/646)
- Bulk importing images has been made easier by adding an "Apply to all" checkbox that uses the same import options for all images that are to be imported. [#624](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/624)
- Extra cursor options have been added to the Preferences that let the user use the native mouse cursors of the OS and toggle the cross cursor on or off for the canvas, and the "Indicators" tab has been renamed to "Cursors".
- Frame duration now appears as a hint tooltip of the frame buttons.
- Added Portuguese translation.

### Changed
- The UI system has changed completely. Users can re-arrange all of the panels and place them wherever they want, resize them or hide them from view. It is also possible to save and load custom UI layouts. [#640](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/640)
- The secondary canvas is hidden from view by default, but it can become visible by going to the Window > Panels.
- The mirroring and pixel perfect options are now global tool options and affect both left and right tools.
- Various timeline improvements, like deleting and cloning multiple selected frames and when creating new frames, tags that are in front of them are being pushed. If the currently selected frames are inside a tag, creating new frames makes the tag bigger. [#648](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/648)
- The custom mouse cursor now scales with the UI. [#642](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/642)
- Importing an image will replace the previous project, if that project is empty.
- Clicking on a layer toggle button (lock, visible & cel linking) now selects that layer.
- Resize Canvas will always display the current size of the project.

- The documentation keyboard shortcut has been changed from F12 to F1.

### Fixed
- Drawing with big brush sizes has been optimized. [#657](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/657) - which was based on [#554](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/554)
- The "same color pixels" mode of the bucket tool has become a lot faster because it now uses a shader. [#649](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/649) - which was based on [#613](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/613)
- Fixed crash when importing non-palette .tres files.
- Deferred mode for the color pickers of gradients has been enabled, so that the gradient preview color only changes on mouse release. Addressed a part of [#645](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/645).
- "From Current Palette" preset option is now disabled when creating a new palette, if there is no current palette, which fixes [#659](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/659)
- Aspect ratio in scale image no longer sets width and height to have the same value, but it works as expected like it does in the create new image dialog.
- macOS shortcuts have been fixed, only Command is needed again instead of Command + Control.
- Fixed a bug where the selection got stuck to the canvas boundaries when they were 1px away from them.
- The export status of a project no longer resets when saving it as a pxo.

- Window transparency has been re-enabled in macOS.
- Guides are a little easier to select and drag now.
- The monochromatic palette has been changed.

### Fixed
- Massively improved memory management by fixing a memory leak. Previously, every time the user made a change, memory kept going up and never coming down. Now, data that can never be recovered, like undo data that have been rewritten in history, are also removed from memory. [4832690](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/commit/48326900d9d9f0b32fd435e56fd5a39bbf13fa36)

### Added
- A total of 9 new tools!
- New selection tools, including elliptical, magic wand, select by color, lasso (freehand selection) and polygonal selection tools.
- A new move tool, that lets you move the content of the current cel, or the content of the selection, if there is any.
- New rectangle and ellipse shape tools. [#456](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/456)
- A new line tool.
- An installer for Windows will be available for v0.9 and future versions! [#486](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/486)
- You can now select multiple cels in the timeline and edit them all at once!
- Frame numbers in the timeline above the cels are now clickable buttons that can be dragged and dropped to re-arrange the frames. Right clicking on these buttons brings up a frame-related menu with options that used to be on the cel right click menu.
- You can now right click a cel to delete its contents.
- Layer dragging and dropping is now also possible.
- A new "fill inside" option has been added in the Pencil tool options. [#489](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/489), based off [#459](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/459)
- You can now name the project name on the "create new project" dialog. [#490](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/490)

### Changed
- The selection system has been completely changed and has become a lot more powerful. See [#129](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/129#issuecomment-756799706) for more details.
- The palette system has been completely replaced with a new one. See [#447](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/447) for more details.
- UI icons have been changed to single-color "symbolic" textures. This removes the need for multiple graphics for each theme type as these new textures can change their modulation on runtime.
- Image color inverting, desaturation and HSV adjusting are now shader based. This improves the performance of these image effects and prevents crashes on large images. [#475](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/475)
