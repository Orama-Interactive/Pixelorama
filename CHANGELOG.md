- Added a new "Performance" tab in the Preferences that exposes options related to the application's FPS to the user.
- Added a new pixel grid, which is a grid of size 1px and it appears after a certain zoom level. ([#427](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/427))
- Addet offset options to the grid. ([#434](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/434))

### Changed
- Undo and redo now work when their respective keyboard shortcuts are being held. ([#405](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/405))
- CPU usage has been significantly been lowered when Pixelorama is idle. ([#394](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/394))
- The FPS of the project animation is now stored in the pxo file. This effectively means that every project can have its own FPS.

- Keyboard shortcut conflicts between tool shortcuts and other shortcuts that use the "Control" key, like menu shortcuts, have been resolved. ([#407](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/407))
- The opacity of a cel and the tile mode opacity are now multiplicative. ([#414](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/414))
- Fixed an issue where adding a new layer did not select it, rather it was selecting the above layer of the previously selected layer. ([#424](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/424))
- Fixed cel opacity not being always updated on the UI. ([#420](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/420))

## [v0.8.2] - 2020-12-12
This update has been brought to you by the contributions of:

PinyaColada, Rémi Verschelde (akien-mga), dasimonde, gschwind, AbhinavKDev, Laurenz Reinthaler (Schweini07)

### Added
- The lighten/darken tool now has a hue shifting mode. It lets users configure the shift in hue, saturation and value of the new shaded pixels. ([#189](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/189))
- Added a "frame properties" option on the popup menu that appears when right-clicking on a cel. This lets the user choose a custom frame delay for that specific frame. ([#357](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/357))
- You can now select if you want rotation to apply in the selection, the current cel, the entire frame, all frames or even all projects (tabs)!
- You can now change the transparency of the Tile Mode in the Preferences. ([#368](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/368))
- Added a "Recent Projects" option in the File menu, to contain the most recently opened projects. ([#370](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/370))
- HiDPI support - Pixelorama's UI can now be scaled in the Preferences. ([#140](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/140))

### Changed
- `~` is now used as a random brush prefix instead of `%`. ([#362](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/362))
- The default path of the dialogs for opening and saving is now the user's desktop folder.
- When there are errors in opening and saving files, the errors appear in the form of a popup dialog, instead of a notification or an OS alert.
- The CJK font (for Chinese & Korean) was changed to DroidSansFallback from NotoSansCJKtc. This results in a much smaller exported `.pck` (over 10MB less!)
- Onion skinned previous and next frames are now being drawn on top of the current frame. This fixes issues where onion skinning would not work with an opaque background.
- In onion skinning, you can now set the past and future steps to 0. ([#380](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/380))

- macOS: Shortcuts with the Control keyboard button have now been changed to use "Command" instead. ([#393](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/393))

### Fixed
- Made .pxo saving safer. In case of a crash while parsing JSON data, the old .pxo file, if it exists, will no longer be overwritten and corrupted.
- Fixed issue where the user could grab and could not let go of the focus of guides even when they were invisible.
- Fixed issues where fully transparent color could not be picked. One of these cases was [#364](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/364).
- Fixed "Export" option in the File menu not working properly and not remembering the directory path and file name when switching between projects (tabs).
- When opening a .pxo project which has guides, they will no longer be added to the project at the first tab too.

- Using the lighten/darken tool on pixels with an alpha value of 0 no longer has an effect on them.
- Fixed freeze when switching to a project of a larger size and using an image effect, with the affected parts being set to something different that "Current cel".

## [v0.8.1] - 2020-10-14
This update has been brought to you by the contributions of:

Laurenz Reinthaler (Schweini07), PinyaColada

### Added
- Buttons for moving the current frame left or right. ([#344](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/344))
- Creating palettes from sprites has been enhanced - you can now choose if you want to get colors from the selection, current cel, entire frame or all frames, and if you want the colors to have an alpha component.
- A new "Cut" option in the Edit menu or by pressing `Ctrl-X`. It cuts (deletes & copies) the selection, and you can later paste it. ([#345](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/345))
- Added a warning dialog when clicking the remove palette button, to prevent accidental palette deletions.
- A new purple theme.

### Changed
- Guides now move with a step of 0.5 pixels. That makes it possible to have guides (and symmetry guides) to be in the middle of pixels.
- Changed how Dark, Gray, Caramel and Light themes look. All theme elements now have the same spacing and margins.

### Fixed
- Most likely fixed an issue that occurred when the user attempted to export the project, which failed due to a locking error (error code 23). (Part of [#331](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/3391))
- Fixed crash where Pixelorama could not load a cached sub-resource. ([#339](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues/339))
- When moving tabs, the projects now move along with their respective tabs.
- Fixed crash where the animation was playing in the mini canvas preview and then the user switched to a project with less frames.
- Fixed issue with the selection rectangle, where if it was being moved while using paste or delete, it went back to its original position. ([#346](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/pull/346))

- Made the layer and timeline buttons have hover textures. (Thanks to Erevoid)
- Brush color interpolation and LightenDarknen's amount now range from 0-100, instead of 0-1.
- Redo has both `Ctrl-Y` and `Shift-Ctrl-Z` as its shortcuts. (Thanks to Schweini07)
- Removed split screen button, you can now drag the second canvas from the right.
- Changed positions of color switch & color default buttons.
- Importing brushes from the Brushes folder now looks inside its subfolders too, but not the subfolders of the subfolders.
- The Brushes folder now gets created if it doesn't exist (tested on Windows)
- Enabled switching between menus in menu bar on hover (Thanks to YeldhamDev)
- The "View" menu remains visible when toggling items (Thanks to YeldhamDev)
- The UI darkens when exiting the application (Thanks to Calinou)
- The bucket tool's "paint all pixels with the same color" now gets limited to the selection, if there is any.
- If the alpha on the color picker is at 0 and any of the other RGB values change, alpha becomes 1. (Issue #54)

### Fixed
- UndoRedo leak (issue #34) (Thanks to qarmin)
- Enabled low processor usage and reduced the amount of times "update()" gets called on Canvas and the rulers, to improve CPU usage. (Thanks to Calinou & Martin1991zab)
- Fixed alpha in custom brushes, because their alpha was being blended along with its RGB values. (Issue #51)
- Fixed "Parent node is busy setting up children, move_child() failed" when the Quit dialog popup was being called. (Issue #90, thanks to Sslaxx)
- Fixed issues with bucket tool and mirroring.
- Fixed issue with invisible layers becomes visible when a layer was added/removed/moved or changed frame.
- Switched to '2D' framebuffer allocation, which results in slightly increased performance and decreased CPU/GPU usage. (Thanks to Calinou)
