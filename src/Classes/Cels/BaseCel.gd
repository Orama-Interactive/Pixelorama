class_name BaseCel
extends RefCounted
## Base class for cel properties.
## "Cel" is short for the term "celluloid" [url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cel[/url].

signal texture_changed  ## Emitted whenever the cel's texture is changed

var opacity := 1.0  ## Opacity/Transparency of the cel.
## The image stored in the cel.
var image_texture: Texture2D:
	get = _get_image_texture
## If the cel is linked then this contains a reference to the link set [Dictionary] this cel is in:
## [param { "cels": Array, "hue": float }].
## [br] If the cel is not linked then it is [code]null[/code].
var link_set = null  # { "cels": Array, "hue": float } or null
var transformed_content: Image  ## Used in transformations (moving, scaling etc with selections).
## Used for individual cel ordering. Used for when cels need to be drawn above or below
## their corresponding layer.

## The content methods deal with the unique content of each cel type. For example, an Image for
