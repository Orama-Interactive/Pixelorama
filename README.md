## Documentation
You can find Online Documentation for Pixelorama here: https://orama-interactive.github.io/Pixelorama-Docs

It's still work in progress so there are some pages missing. If you want to contribute, you can do so in [Pixelorama-Docs' GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama-Docs).

## Cloning Instructions
Pixelorama uses Godot 3.2, so you will need to have it in order to run the project.
As of right now, most of the code is written using GDScript, so the mono version of Godot is not required, but Pixelorama should also work with it.

Pixelorama uses a [GDNative addon for gif exporting](https://github.com/novhack/godot-gifexporter), since it's not possible to do it natively with Godot. In order to ensure that your clone works properly, you will need to use the command `git submodule update --init` right after you clone.

Note that the addon only works in Windows and Linux platforms, for the time being. Pixelorama should run without it fine on other platforms. 

## Current features as of version v0.7:

- Choosing between 7 tools – pencil, eraser, fill bucket, lighten/darken, color picker, rectangle select and zoom– and mapping them to both of your left and right mouse buttons.
- Are you an animator? Pixelorama has its own animation timeline just for you! You can work at an individual cel level, where each cel refers to a unique layer and frame. Supports onion skinning, cel linking, motion drawing and frame grouping with tags.
- Different tool options for each of the mouse buttons.
- Custom brushes! Load your brushes from files or select them in your project with the selection tool, and they will get stored in `.pxo` files!
- Random custom brushes! Every time you draw, expect to see a different random result!
- Create or import custom palettes!
- Pattern filling! Use the bucket tool to fill out an area with a pattern of your choosing.
- Import images and edit them inside Pixelorama. If you import multiple files, they will be added as individual animation frames. Importing spritesheets is also supported.
- Export your gorgeous art as `PNG` or `GIF` files. Exporting your projects as spritesheets is also possible.
- Pixel perfect mode for perfect lines, for the pencil, eraser & lighten/darken tools.
- Save and open your projects as Pixelorama's custom file format, `.pxo`
- Undo/Redo support!
- Autosave support, with data recovery in case of a software crash.

- Horizontal & vertical mirrored drawing!
- Tile Mode for pattern creation!
- Split screen mode to see your masterpiece twice! And a mini canvas preview area to see it thrice!

- Generate outlines for your images!
- Υou can zoom in and out with the mouse scroll wheel or the `+` and `-` keys respectively, and pan by clicking the middle mouse button, by holding `Space` or with the arrow keys!
